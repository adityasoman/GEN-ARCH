# Unit Layout problem

The unit layout is highly dependent on the use case scenario of the space so the interaction and the participation of the user of the space is extremely important at this stage. The unit layout and the subsequent unit detailing stage in its full complexity are outside the scope of the thesis . Only certain approaches and potential systems will be proposed for solving them.
