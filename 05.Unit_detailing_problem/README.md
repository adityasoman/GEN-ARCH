# Unit Detailing Problem
The Unit detailing problem deals with generation of design details for the units developed in the unit layout problem. Design details may consists of the following things . Materials and components of the various infill layers in the unit like Walls, Windows, facades, floors, ceilings, installations, furniture's etc. The clear distinction between the structure and infill has been made in the open building concept and the infill layer is the main element which will be detailed in the unit detailing problem. The structure layer should ideally be resolved in the unit assignment problem itself sop at this stage there is already information regarding the structure of the building.

The stakeholders involved in this stage of the layout problem are the Architects, Contractors, End users of the space/ Home-owners , Building Component manufacturers. The system created for solving this problem would make the Architect/ Designer as the mediator between the end user and the rest of the stakeholder generating the necessary inputs for the clear communication.

The nature of the problem at this stage will involve background knowledge about a lot of subjects like construction processes, building material properties, fabrication and construction processes etc. This makes the scale of the problem very large and not manageable to solve in the time frame of this thesis, However a possible initial framework for solving this problem is proposed in this thesis.
